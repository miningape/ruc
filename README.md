# Models/graphing software created for our project in mathematics

Interpreted using Python 3

Using the packages numpy, scipy, and matplotlib

- calc.py was used for some initial modelling and can be ignored
- matheiu.py graphs our model based on mathieus equation
- kronig_penney.py graphs our model based on the Kronig-Penney model
- coefficients.py uses a selection the results (coefficients) produced by fourier_analysis_cpp, and graphs the fourier series described by those coefficients
- results.csv contains all the 3d coefficients on the interval [-100, 100]
